Abraham v. State of Maharashtra (2003) 2 SCC 649 (para 15) has held that it was not mandatory for the police to arrest a person only because his/her anticipatory bail had been rejected.
Section 438(1), therefore, cannot be invoked on the basis of vague and general allegations, as if to arm oneself in perpetuity against a possible arrest.

It was also submitted that Section 438 being part of procedure established by law is to be construed in a fair, just and reasonable manner.
Abraham v. State of Maharastra23 held that it was not mandatory for the police to arrest a person only because his/her anticipatory bail had been rejected.
Sibbia (supra) noticed this fact, and also that significantly, Section 438 is not hedged with any obligation on the courts power, to impose conditions.
At the same time, if there are indications in any special law or statute, which exclude relief under Section 438 (1) they would have to be duly considered.
provides: may direct that any person who has been released on bail under this Chapter be arrested and commit him to custody.
(12) The observations in Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra & Ors57 (and other similar judgments) that no restrictive conditions at all can be imposed, while granting anticipatory bail are hereby overruled.
