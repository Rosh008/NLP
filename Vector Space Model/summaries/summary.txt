Two of the accused were acquitted as their presence was found to be doubtful.
The fact that a verbal duel followed by scuffle took place between the parties culminating in injuries is a concurrent finding of fact by two Courts.
An accused is not required to establish or prove his defence beyond all reasonable doubt, unlike the prosecution.
The fact that a defence may not have been taken by an accused under Section 313, Cr.P.C.
again cannot absolve the prosecution from proving its case beyond all reasonable doubt.
It is well settled that the prosecution must stand or fall on its own feet.
Even the present case is a glaring example of irresponsible investigation.
It is not a case of faulty investigation simpliciter but is an investigation coloured with motivation or an attempt to ensure that the suspect can go scot- free
A defective investigation shall be completely different from no investigation at all coupled with suppression of the injury report arising out of another F.I.R with regard to the same occurrence.
Gazoo (supra) is also distinguishable on its facts as it related only to failure in obtaining the serologist report.
